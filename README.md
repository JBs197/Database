# Database

[2021/01/10]
Completed the bad_apple function, which will replace any spreadsheet that is not SQL-compliant, using the archive bin files made by Retriever. Database can currently assemble and print its own custom-made data tables based on user search criteria, however it has no flexibility with regards to variations of search criteria between catalogues. For example, a command to build a table from multiple catalogues containing "total population by sex and age" will fail to incorporate the catalogue variable "total population by age and sex".
